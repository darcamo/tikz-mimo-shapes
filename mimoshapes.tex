% This file defines some new node shapes to use with tikz.
%
% The start code was taken and modified from the example in
% http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/d-flip-flops-and-shift-register/
%
% The shapes defined here are:
% - mimoone
% - mimotwo
% - mimothree
% - mimoind
% - boxtwo
% - boxthree
%
% For the three first shapes you can epecify either the "right antennas" or
% "left antennas" option to indicate the antennas position. You can also
% change some distances by specifying the options "antenna offset",
% "antenna base height" and "antenna side" with some value.
%
% For the last two shapes you can change the appearance with the "circle
% fill color", "circle stroke color" and "circle radius" options.
